In order to divide properly in Ruby, you must denote a decimal with either the divisor or the dividend.
4.0/2.0 == 2.0
5.0/2 == 2.5
10 / 3.0 == 3.333333...


Often, when we multiply or divide numbers in Ruby, we are left with a bunch of digits trailing the decimal point. Here’s how to fix that up:
Template: “%.xf” % number


E.g.  To round to 2 decimal places: 
money = 2.903
print “I have %.2f” % money → I have 2.90
