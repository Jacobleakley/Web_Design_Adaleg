# Create a Room with classes

# You will be creating a building strucutre that allows
# a user to navigate from room to room.
# Focusing on the room first, think about what attributes a 
# room has.
# From our example
# exits, description, roomID (to uniquely ID every room)

# Examples of roomID could be kitchen, laundry room, dining room,
# library, etc...

# Exercise 1: Create a class called Room that has the attributes
# described above: exits, description, roomID/Name

# Exercise 2: Create an object called classroom using your
# Room class. The classroom needs 1 exit, a description and
# roomID (or name) called "classroom"
